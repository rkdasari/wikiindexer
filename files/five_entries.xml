'''Russ Conway''' (2 September 1925 – 16 November 2000) was a British [[popular music]] [[pianist]].&lt;ref name=&quot;British Hit Singles &amp; Albums&quot;&gt;{{cite book

==Career==
Conway was born '''Trevor Herbert Stanford''' in [[Bristol]] England.&lt;ref name=&quot;Larkin&quot;&gt;Larkin C 'Virgin Encyclopedia of Sixties Music' (Muze UK Ltd, 1997) ISBN 0-7535-0149-X p125&lt;/ref&gt; He won a scholarship to [[Bristol Cathedral Choir School]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Larkin&quot; /&gt; and was largely self-taught on piano as he whiled away hours as a youngster during a three-year term in borstal. His father then let him join the [[Merchant Navy (United Kingdom)|Merchant Navy]]. 

Conscripted into the [[Royal Navy]] in 1942, he served in the Merchant Navy from 1942 to 1948, and was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Medal (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Service Medal]] as signalman in a minesweeping flotilla &quot;for distinguished service, efficiency and zeal&quot; in clearance of mines in the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] and operations during the relief of [[Greece]] 1944-45. During his Navy service, he lost the tip of the 3rd finger of his right hand while using a bread slicer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Larkin&quot; /&gt; He was discharged on health grounds because of a stomach ulcer.

Conway was talent-spotted while playing in a [[London]] [[nightclub|club]], signed to EMI's [[Columbia Graphophone Company|Columbia]] label and spent the mid-1950s providing backing for artists on their roster, including [[Gracie Fields]] and [[Joan Regan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Larkin&quot; /&gt; He recorded his first [[solo (music)|solo]] [[single (music)|single]] &quot;Party Pops&quot; in 1957, a &quot;medley of standard songs&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Larkin&quot; /&gt; which included &quot;Roll the Carpet Up&quot; and &quot;The Westminster Waltz&quot;.

Between 1957 and 1963, Conway had 20 U.K. chart hits, achieving a cumulative total of 83 weeks on the [[UK Singles Chart]] in 1959 alone.&lt;ref name=&quot;British Hit Singles &amp; Albums&quot;/&gt;  This included two self-penned number one [[instrumental]]s, &quot;Side Saddle&quot; and &quot;Roulette&quot;, the latter deposing [[Elvis Presley]]'s &quot;[[A Fool Such As I]]&quot;. He was a fixture on light entertainment [[Television|TV]] shows and [[radio]] for many years afterwards, appearing at the [[London Palladium]] on a number of occasions&lt;ref name=&quot;Larkin&quot; /&gt; and becoming a regular on the [[Billy Cotton Band Show]] for several seasons. He also made recordings as a vocalist.

He was the subject of ''[[This Is Your Life (UK TV series)|This Is Your Life]]'' in 1959, when he was surprised by [[Eamonn Andrews]] during a recording session at the BBC’s Studio 1 at 201 Piccadilly, London.

His career was blighted by ill health, including a nervous breakdown and subsequently a stroke, which prevented him from performing between 1968 and 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;Larkin&quot; /&gt; He also at times drank heavily and smoked up to 80 cigarettes a day. He was prescribed anti-depressants and had periods of severe self-doubt. But he kept up playing. Having been diagnosed with stomach cancer in the late 1980s, in 1990 he founded the Russ Conway Cancer Fund with his friend, writer and [[Presenter|broadcaster]] Richard Hope-Hawkins, and they staged [[charitable organization|charity]] gala shows in major theatres that raised thousands of pounds for [[cancer]] charities.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}

He appeared as himself in [[French and Saunders]]' 1994 Christmas special, playing &quot;I Like It&quot; in their spoof of ''[[The Piano]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title= 1994 Christmas Special|episodelink= |series= [[French and Saunders]]|serieslink= |credits= |network= [[Gold (TV channel)|Gold]]|station= |airdate= 24 April 2009|season= |seriesno= |number= |minutes= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conway, who never married, died on 16 November 2000.&lt;ref&gt;GRO Register of Deaths NOV 2000 C48E 22 EASTBOURNE. DoB = 2 September 1925&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Hope-Hawkins delivered the main eulogy at Conway's [[funeral]] held at the historic [[St Mary Redcliffe|St Mary's Church]], [[Redcliffe, Bristol|Redcliffe]], Bristol. [[Elton John]] sent a wreath. In 2001 Hope-Hawkins devised, staged and directed a tribute to Conway at the [[Colston Hall]], Bristol, with an all-star cast. The £11,000 raised by the event was donated to St Peter's Hospice, Bristol.
